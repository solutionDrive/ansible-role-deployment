Role Name
=========

Role to prepare Servers for Deployment. Place ssh-key-Pairs for Authentication with Git-Repositorys

Requirements
------------

none

Role Variables
--------------


Dependencies
------------

none

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }

License

BSD

Files
-----
the following files are encrypted with our base password:
+ auth.json
+ id_rsa
+ id_rsa.pub

This will only work in Projects which are using this insecure base-Password. To be able to use this
role in Projects with greater security-needs (with different vaultpass), this files can be placed in the files-directory
of the Ansible-Project and can be re-encrypted with the new Password. It is important that 
1. the files are named differently
2. the default-Variables of this role containing the standard-Filenames are overwritten with the new Filenames.


SSH Host Keys
-------------
The public keys for the following SSH hosts are stored here:
* github.com
* bitbucket.org
* packagist.org

This is important to avoid scanning for ssh keys on each ansible run.

They can be obtained/generated by:

    ssh-keyscan -t rsa {bitbucket.org,github.com,packagist.org}

Please make sure that they are up-to-date and correct(!).
